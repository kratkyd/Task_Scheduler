-do input error properly (read up on error handling)
-try to fit start time into the same schedule as the repeating one
-from documentation /st default is current time, but without it it starts after the time set for interval, what?
    -from "run program now" example, set the current time, do I really need to get current time from the task?
    -run the program from the .py script directly, or create task in a minute or so?
-run vscode as admin might not be a good idea
-test for batch file
-might have more to do on the error handling (error of invalid iso format handles itself, is it correct?)
-should parameters be arguments or options?
-don't know how to do --help properly
-replace pandas with something smaller
-what was shell=true, check=true in schtasks again?
